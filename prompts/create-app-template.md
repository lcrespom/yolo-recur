I want you to create a new Web App project with the following technical stack:

- TypeScript
- Modern React with Vite build tooling, Vitest and React Testing Library for testing
- Code formatting following `.prettierrc` settings.
- TanStack Router
- Tailwind
- Daisy UI
- Pre-select Dark/Light color theme based on system's settings
- Lucide for icons
- A responsive nav bar, initially containing
  - The app title. Clicking it navigates to the root path /
  - Page 1: navigates to /page1
  - Page 2: navigates to /page2

Create also a setup-steps.md document describing all steps followed to create the app
scaffolding, with the commands a user would type to install all requirements.
